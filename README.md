# Ultrarelativistic electron beams accelerated by terawatt scalable kHz laser

This repository contains supplementary material for the paper C. M. Lazzarini et al., "Ultrarelativistic electron beams accelerated by terawatt scalable kHz laser", *Physics of Plasmas* **31**, 030703 (2024); [https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0189051](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0189051).

The supplementary material consists of the raw data and the **[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)** notebook with the set of commands that have been used for generating figures.

The analysis is performed using Python programming language and relies on several Python packages (see the `requirements.txt` file).

### How to obtain the data

The raw data used in this work are openly available in a **[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11579273)** repository. You may download the data as a .zip archive (4.6 MB) on the following link: [https://zenodo.org/records/11579273/files/data.zip?download=1](https://zenodo.org/records/11579273/files/data.zip?download=1).

### How to obtain the notebook

The notebook `analysis.ipynb` is stored in this GitHub repository. You may either download the whole repository as a .zip archive by selecting "Code" and then "Download ZIP", or use `git`:

1. Clone the repository: ``` $> git clone https://github.com/valenpe7/5.0189051.git ```
2. Pull in new changes: ``` $> git pull ```

### How to launch the notebook

If you have downloaded the notebook and the data and have all the requirements installed on your computer, you may launch the notebook locally. Alternatively, if you do not have installed all the requirements, you may launch the notebook on-line using
